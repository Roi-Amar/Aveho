"""
Aveho (by Roi) was built as a small fast side project in order to give a virtual greenscreen with no real greenscreen to the masses.
Feel free to share and use the code.

Aveho provides you with a virtual green screen you can use in a 3rd party applications like OBS or ZOOM
(hint: look for the chroma key filters and set it to filter green)
"""

"""
Make sure you have pyhon3 installed
In order to run Aveho you will need Aveho.py, production.py and gs_.mp4
If for some reason your camera feed won't show try to switch the number of the camera inside production.py file.

Once you are done tuning Aveho, you can set the masks windows to not pop up the next time. Check the production.py and put '#' before the window you want to hide.
